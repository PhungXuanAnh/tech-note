# Resolving Multi-Monitor Detection Failures on Ubuntu 22.04 After Screen Lock: An In-Depth Technical Guide 

## Executive Summary of the Multi-Monitor Lock Screen Anomaly 

This report provides a comprehensive technical analysis and resolution strategy for a specific failure mode observed in Ubuntu 22.04. The core problem is the system's failure to re-detect all external displays after a screen lock and unlock cycle, causing a functional multi-monitor setup to degrade. This is not an initial setup error but a state-resume failure within the Linux graphics stack. The issue stems from a fragile interaction between the NVIDIA proprietary driver, the GNOME Display Manager (GDM3), the display server (Wayland or X11), and kernel power management. The solutions presented focus on stabilizing this re-initialization process through driver management, display environment configuration, and automated workarounds.

***

## Problem Definition 

In this scenario, a correctly functioning multi-monitor setup, such as the three-screen configuration provided by the user, degrades after a screen lock and subsequent unlock cycle. The system fails to re-detect one or more of the external displays, reverting to a reduced-screen configuration. This issue is not a result of an incorrect initial setup but rather a state-resume failure within the Linux graphics stack, where the system is unable to correctly re-initialize the full display topology after a power-saving state transition.

***

## The Causal Nexus 

The root cause of this anomaly is a complex and often fragile interaction between several core system components: the **NVIDIA proprietary graphics driver**, the **GNOME Display Manager (GDM3)**, the active **display server protocol** (typically Wayland by default in Ubuntu 22.04, or the traditional X11), and **kernel-level power management services**. The act of locking the screen initiates a critical sequence where monitors enter a low-power state and GDM3 takes control of the display outputs. The failure occurs during the re-awakening of the monitors and the hand-off back to the user session, where driver instability often manifests. This behavior is functionally identical to issues widely reported after a full system suspend/resume cycle, as both events rely on a similar, failure-prone display re-initialization sequence. The graphics stack, particularly with NVIDIA's driver, struggles to reliably re-enumerate and re-initialize all display outputs after a power state change.

## Strategic Solution Pathways 

This guide outlines a multi-pronged resolution strategy, ordered from the least invasive to more advanced solutions, to systematically stabilize the graphics stack.

* **Graphics Driver Remediation**: Address the most frequent point of failure by ensuring a clean, stable, and correctly configured NVIDIA driver installation. This involves purging potentially corrupt installations and selecting a known-stable driver version.
* **Display Environment Configuration**: Mitigate incompatibilities by transitioning from the often-problematic Wayland display server to the more mature X11 environment. This also includes ensuring configuration consistency between the user's desktop session and the GDM3 lock screen.
* **Advanced System-Level Adjustments**: Modify low-level system behavior by injecting kernel boot parameters and adjusting BIOS/UEFI settings to alter how the graphics driver is loaded and how power states are managed.
* **Automated Workaround Implementation**: As a final recourse, deploy a custom script that forcibly re-applies the correct monitor configuration automatically upon every screen unlock event.

The solutions focus on making the re-initialization process more robust, either by using more stable components, forcing correct driver behavior, or brute-forcing the correct state after the transition has occurred.

## Foundational Diagnostics: Building a System Profile 

Before attempting modifications, a thorough diagnostic assessment is imperative. A "diagnostics-first" methodology allows for the precise identification of the failure point, enabling a targeted and effective fix.

### Interrogating the Graphics Hardware and Driver Stack 

A baseline understanding of the system's graphics hardware and driver status is the first critical step.

* **Hardware Identification**: Use `lspci` to confirm the exact NVIDIA GPU model, as compatibility can be highly specific.
    ```bash
    lspci | grep -iE 'vga|3d|display'
    ```
* **Driver Status Verification**: Use `nvidia-smi` to query the driver's state. A successful output confirms the proprietary driver is loaded; an error indicates a fundamental installation problem.
    ```bash
    nvidia-smi
    ```
* **Detailed Hardware Listing**: Use `lshw` for a comprehensive report. If the configuration line shows `driver=nouveau`, the open-source driver is active. If it shows `UNCLAIMED`, no driver has successfully bound to the hardware.
    ```bash
    sudo lshw -C display
    ```

### Identifying the Active Windowing System (Wayland vs. X11) 

The choice of display server is a pivotal factor in stability with NVIDIA drivers. Ubuntu 22.04 defaults to Wayland, but its support within the NVIDIA ecosystem is less mature than X11, especially concerning state changes.

* **Command-Line Check**: Determine the session type. The output will be `wayland` or `x11`.
    ```bash
    echo "$XDG_SESSION_TYPE"
    ```
* **GUI Check**: Navigate to **Settings > About**. The "Windowing System" entry will explicitly state Wayland or X11.

### Forensic Analysis of System Logs 

System logs provide direct clues to the cause of the failure.

* **Kernel Message Analysis with `dmesg`**: Print the kernel's message buffer and filter for graphics-related terms to find low-level errors.
    ```bash
    dmesg | grep -iE 'nvidia|nouveau|drm'
    ```
* **Systemd Journal Analysis with `journalctl`**: Query the systemd journal for errors that coincide with the lock/unlock event.
    * **General Errors Since Boot**: Check for high-priority messages logged since startup.
        ```bash
        journalctl -p 3 -b
        ```
    * **Targeted Service Logs**: View recent entries from GDM3 and gnome-shell immediately after reproducing the issue.
        ```bash
        journalctl -u gdm3.service --since "10 minutes ago"
        journalctl /usr/bin/gnome-shell --since "10 minutes ago"
        ```
* **Xorg Log Analysis (if using X11)**: If using an X11 session, check `/var/log/Xorg.0.log` for error (EE) and warning (WW) lines.
    ```bash
    grep -iE '(EE)|(WW)' /var/log/Xorg.0.log
    ```

## Primary Remediation Path: Comprehensive NVIDIA Driver Management 

The NVIDIA proprietary driver is the most common point of failure. A systematic approach to driver management is the most effective first step.

### The Canonical Approach: The 'Additional Drivers' Utility 

Always attempt this user-friendly tool first.

* **GUI Method**: Navigate to **Software & Updates > Additional Drivers**. The interface lists available drivers and indicates a "tested" or recommended version, which is the ideal starting point.
* **Command-Line Equivalent**: Use `ubuntu-drivers` for the same functionality.
    * List available drivers and identify the recommended one:
        ```bash
        ubuntu-drivers devices
        ```
    * Automatically install the recommended driver:
        ```bash
        sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall
        ```

### The Clean Slate Protocol: A Full Purge and Reinstallation 

If issues persist, residual files from previous installations can cause conflicts. A complete purge ensures a truly clean installation and is a critical troubleshooting step.

1.  **Purge All NVIDIA Packages**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get purge '^nvidia-.*'
    ```
2.  **Remove Residual Configurations**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt autoremove
    ```
3.  **Reboot**: This is essential to ensure NVIDIA kernel modules are fully unloaded.
4.  **Reinstall**: After rebooting, use the `sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall` command to install the recommended driver on the clean system.

### Strategic Driver Versioning 

The latest driver is not always the most stable. Community feedback indicates varying success with different driver series. For example, the **535 series** is often cited as a stable fallback when newer versions introduce regressions.

| Driver Series | Status/Recommendation | Reported Pros                                                  | Reported Cons/Issues                                             | Relevant Sources |
| :------------ | :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------- |
| **525** | Use with caution      | May work on some hardware configurations.                      | Reported as non-functional by some users where older versions worked.  |        |
| **535** | **Recommended Fallback** | Often cited as a stable version that resolves issues introduced by newer drivers.  Generally a good balance of features and stability.  | May still exhibit hardware-specific issues.                      |        |
| **545/550+** | Bleeding Edge         | Includes the latest features and performance improvements.     | "Reported as unstable or non-functional by some users, leading to a downgrade. " |        |

**Recommended Strategy**:
1.  Always start with the version marked as `(recommended)`.
2.  If problems continue, perform a clean slate purge and then manually install a well-regarded version, such as `nvidia-driver-535`.
    ```bash
    sudo apt install nvidia-driver-535
    ```
3.  For the latest drivers, add the official PPA:
    ```bash
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
    sudo apt update
    ```

### Navigating Secure Boot and MOK Enrollment 

UEFI Secure Boot requires third-party kernel modules like the NVIDIA driver to be cryptographically signed.

* **The MOK Enrollment Process**: When installing the NVIDIA driver with Secure Boot enabled, the installer prompts you to create a password for Machine Owner Key (MOK) enrollment. On the next reboot, a blue "MOK management" screen will appear. You must select "Enroll MOK," confirm the key, and enter the password. Failure to do this will block the driver from loading.
* **Alternative: Disabling Secure Boot**: A simpler workaround is to enter the computer's BIOS/UEFI settings and disable Secure Boot, which removes the signature verification requirement.

***

## Configuring the Display Environment: GDM3, X11, and Wayland 

Instability can often be traced to the driver's interaction with the display server (Wayland/X11) and display manager (GDM3).

### The Wayland/NVIDIA Conflict 

Wayland's integration with NVIDIA's proprietary driver is less mature than X11's, leading to well-documented instabilities, especially in multi-monitor state management upon resume from sleep or lock. Many display anomalies on NVIDIA systems are resolved by switching away from Wayland.

### Procedure for Transitioning to an X.org Session 

Switching to an X.org (X11) session is one of the most effective solutions for NVIDIA users on Ubuntu 22.04.

* **Method 1 (Recommended): The Login Screen Cog**: At the GDM3 login screen, click your username, then click the small gear icon that appears in the bottom-right corner. Select "Ubuntu on Xorg" from the menu before entering your password. This choice will be remembered for future logins.
* **Method 2 (Forceful): Editing the GDM3 Configuration**: If the gear icon is missing, you can force the system to default to X11.
    1.  Open the file with root privileges:
        ```bash
        sudo nano /etc/gdm3/custom.conf
        ```
    2.  Find the line `#WaylandEnable=false` and uncomment it by removing the `#`.
    3.  Save the file and exit.
    4.  Restart the display manager:
        ```bash
        sudo systemctl restart gdm3
        ```

### Unifying Display Configurations (monitors.xml) 

A subtle cause of issues is a "configuration schism" between the user's desktop session and the GDM3 lock screen environment. GDM3 runs as its own user (`gdm`) and maintains a separate monitor configuration. If these are out of sync, the system can fail to restore the correct layout after an unlock.

* **The Problem**: The user's settings are in `~/.config/monitors.xml`, while GDM3's are in `/var/lib/gdm3/.config/monitors.xml`.
* **The Solution**: Manually synchronize the two files. First, arrange your monitors perfectly in **Settings > Displays**. This updates your local `monitors.xml`. Then, copy this file to the GDM3 directory.
    ```bash
    sudo cp ~/.config/monitors.xml /var/lib/gdm3/.config/
    ```
* **Troubleshooting**: If this fails, your `monitors.xml` may be corrupt. Delete it (`rm ~/.config/monitors.xml`), log out and back in, reconfigure displays, and then repeat the `sudo cp` command.

***

## Advanced System and Kernel-Level Interventions 

If the problem persists, the next step is to modify kernel boot parameters and system firmware settings.

### Kernel Parameter Injection via GRUB 

Kernel boot parameters can alter how drivers are initialized, often resolving fundamental detection issues.

* **The `nvidia-drm.modeset=1` Parameter**: This is a critical parameter for modern NVIDIA drivers. It instructs the driver to enable Kernel Mode Setting (KMS), allowing the kernel's Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) to manage display modes, which is essential for reliable detection after state changes.
* **Procedure**:
    1.  Open the GRUB configuration file:
        ```bash
        sudo nano /etc/default/grub
        ```
    2.  Locate the line beginning with `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=`.
    3.  Add the parameter inside the quotes:
        ```
        GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash nvidia-drm.modeset=1"
        ```
    4.  Save the file and exit.
    5.  Apply the change by updating GRUB:
        ```bash
        sudo update-grub
        ```
    6.  Reboot the system.

### BIOS/UEFI Configuration for Optimal Compatibility 

System firmware settings can dictate how the OS interacts with hardware.

* **Graphics Mode (Hybrid vs. Discrete)**: On laptops with both integrated and dedicated GPUs, the BIOS may offer a choice between "Hybrid Graphics" (NVIDIA Optimus) and "Discrete Graphics". While less power-efficient, selecting "Discrete" can simplify the driver's task and resolve external display issues by removing the complexity of GPU switching.
* **ACPI Sleep States**: Some systems have a BIOS setting for "Sleep State" with options like "Windows 10" or "Linux". Selecting the "Linux" option can improve power management compatibility with the Linux kernel, leading to more reliable resume and lock screen behavior.

## The Automation Fallback: Scripting a Post-Unlock Display Reset 

For persistent issues, a scripted workaround can provide a reliable solution by forcibly resetting the display configuration after every unlock. **This method is only effective in an X11 session**.

### Step 1: Crafting the `xrandr` Reset Command 

`xrandr` is a command-line tool for controlling displays in X11.

1.  **Identify Display Names**: Run `xrandr` to list all display outputs and note the names of your connected monitors (e.g., `DP-1`, `HDMI-1`, `eDP-1`).
2.  **Build the Command**: Construct a single `xrandr` command that defines your entire desired layout. Test it in the terminal until it works perfectly. Adjust output names, modes (resolutions), and `--pos` (position) coordinates as needed.
    * **Example Command**:
        ```bash
        xrandr --output eDP-1 --primary --mode 1920x1080 --pos 1080x1080 --output DP-1 --mode 1920x1080 --pos 0x0 --output HDMI-1 --mode 1920x1080 --pos 1920x0
        ```

| Goal                                       | `xrandr` Flag          | Example Usage                               |
| :----------------------------------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| Set a monitor's resolution                 | `--mode <resolution>`  | `xrandr --output DP-1 --mode 1920x1080`      |
| Set a monitor as primary                   | `--primary`            | `xrandr --output eDP-1 --primary`           |
| Position a monitor to the right of another | `--right-of <monitor>` | `xrandr --output DP-1 --right-of eDP-1`     |
| Position a monitor above another           | `--above <monitor>`    | `xrandr --output DP-1 --above eDP-1`        |
| Position a monitor at specific coordinates | `--pos <X>x<Y>`        | `xrandr --output DP-1 --pos 1920x0`         |
| Turn a monitor off                         | `--off`                | `xrandr --output HDMI-1 --off`              |



### Step 2: Monitoring the D-Bus for Unlock Events 

A script can listen for D-Bus signals to trigger the `xrandr` command when the screen is unlocked.

* **The `dbus-monitor` Script**:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    dbus-monitor --session "type='signal',interface='org.gnome.ScreenSaver'" | \
    while read -r line; do
        if echo "$line" | grep -q "member=ActiveChanged" && echo "$line" | grep -q "boolean false"; then
            # Screen has been unlocked.
            # Wait a moment for the desktop to stabilize.
            sleep 2
            # Execute the full xrandr command.
            # IMPORTANT: Replace the following line with your own tested command.
            /usr/bin/xrandr --output eDP-1 --primary --mode 1920x1080 --pos 1080x1080 --output DP-1 --mode 1920x1080 --pos 0x0 --output HDMI-1 --mode 1920x1080 --pos 1920x0
        fi
    done
    ```

### Step 3: Deployment as a Systemd User Service 

To run the script automatically, deploy it as a systemd user service.

1.  **Create the Script File**: Save the script from Step 2 to `~/.local/bin/fix-monitors.sh` and make it executable.
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
    # Use a text editor like nano to create and paste the script into the file
    nano ~/.local/bin/fix-monitors.sh
    chmod +x ~/.local/bin/fix-monitors.sh
    ```
2.  **Create the Service File**: Create a new file at `~/.config/systemd/user/monitor-fix.service`.
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
    nano ~/.config/systemd/user/monitor-fix.service
    ```
    Paste the following content into the file:
    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=Fix monitor layout after screen unlock

    [Service]
    ExecStart=%h/.local/bin/fix-monitors.sh
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=10

    [Install]
    WantedBy=default.target
    ```
3.  **Enable and Start the Service**: Use `systemctl` with the `--user` flag.
    ```bash
    systemctl --user enable monitor-fix.service
    systemctl --user start monitor-fix.service
    ```
This service will now run in the background and restore the correct monitor layout every time you unlock your screen.

***

## Synthesis and Strategic Recommendations 

The issue is a multifaceted problem, but a stable configuration is achievable by following a methodical troubleshooting process.

### Recommended Course of Action 

The following ordered strategy has the highest probability of success:

1.  **Switch to an "Ubuntu on Xorg" Session**: This is the single most impactful first step, removing the Wayland/NVIDIA incompatibility layer. Do this via the gear icon on the GDM3 login screen.
2.  **Perform a Clean Driver Installation**: Completely purge all NVIDIA packages (`sudo apt purge '^nvidia-.*' && sudo apt autoremove`), reboot, and reinstall the recommended driver (`sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall`) to eliminate file corruption or conflicts.
3.  **Synchronize GDM3 and User Monitor Configurations**: After setting displays correctly, copy the user config file to the GDM3 directory (`sudo cp ~/.config/monitors.xml /var/lib/gdm3/.config/`) to resolve the configuration schism.
4.  **Add the `nvidia-drm.modeset=1` Kernel Parameter**: If the issue persists, edit `/etc/default/grub`, add the parameter, and run `sudo update-grub` to enable a more robust display management mode.
5.  **Implement the Automated `xrandr` Script**: As a final and definitive workaround, deploy the `dbus-monitor` and `xrandr` script as a systemd user service. This brute-force approach ensures the correct layout is re-applied after every unlock.

By systematically working through these steps, users can effectively diagnose and resolve this frustrating multi-monitor issue.
