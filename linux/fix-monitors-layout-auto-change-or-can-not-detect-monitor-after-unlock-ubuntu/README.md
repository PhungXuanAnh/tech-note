# Multi-Monitor Fix for Ubuntu 22.04+ 

## Quick Setup (Automated)

This repository contains scripts to automatically fix multi-monitor detection issues that occur after screen lock/unlock cycles on Ubuntu systems with NVIDIA graphics. For example after lock/unlock screen these issues can happen:
- Can not detect monitor
- Monitor's layout is changed automatically

### üöÄ One-Line Installation

```bash
# Download and run the setup script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/monitor-fix/main/setup-monitor-fix.sh && chmod +x setup-monitor-fix.sh && ./setup-monitor-fix.sh
```

Or if you have the files locally:

```bash
# Make executable and run
chmod +x setup-monitor-fix.sh && ./setup-monitor-fix.sh
```

### üìã What the Script Does

1. **System Check**: Verifies NVIDIA GPU, driver status, and session type
2. **Monitor Detection**: Automatically detects your current monitor configuration
3. **Script Generation**: Creates a custom monitor fix script for your specific setup
4. **Service Installation**: Sets up a systemd user service to run automatically
5. **Configuration Sync**: Synchronizes monitor settings between user and GDM3
6. **Testing Tools**: Creates test scripts for troubleshooting

### üéØ Features

### üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

- Ubuntu 22.04+ (or similar Linux distribution)
- NVIDIA Graphics Card with proprietary drivers
- X11 session (recommended over Wayland)
- Multi-monitor setup

### üìÅ Files Created

After running the setup script, the following files will be created:

```
~/.local/bin/fix-monitors.sh           # Main monitor fix script
~/.config/systemd/user/monitor-fix.service  # Systemd service
~/.local/bin/test-monitor-fix.sh       # Test and diagnostic script
~/monitor-fix-setup.log                # Installation log
~/.local/share/monitor-fix.log         # Runtime logs
```

### üîß Manual Installation Steps

If you prefer to understand what's happening or need to customize:

1. **Download the setup script**:
   ```bash
   wget setup-monitor-fix.sh
   chmod +x setup-monitor-fix.sh
   ```

2. **Run the setup**:
   ```bash
   ./setup-monitor-fix.sh
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts** and review the detected configuration

4. **Test the setup**:
   ```bash
   ~/.local/bin/test-monitor-fix.sh
   ```

### üß™ Testing the Fix

1. **Lock your screen**: `Super+L` or via the system menu
2. **Unlock your screen** and verify all monitors are detected
3. **Check the logs**:
   ```bash
   # View recent monitor fix activity
   tail -f ~/.local/share/monitor-fix.log
   
   # Check service status
   systemctl --user status monitor-fix.service
   
   # View service logs
   journalctl --user -u monitor-fix.service -f
   ```

### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

#### Service Not Running
```bash
# Check service status
systemctl --user status monitor-fix.service

# Restart the service
systemctl --user restart monitor-fix.service

# Check for errors
journalctl --user -u monitor-fix.service --since "10 minutes ago"
```

#### Monitors Not Restoring
```bash
# Test the xrandr command manually
~/.local/bin/test-monitor-fix.sh

# Check if X11 session is active
echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE

# Verify monitor names haven't changed
xrandr --query | grep connected
```

#### After System Updates
```bash
# Re-run the setup script to update configuration
./setup-monitor-fix.sh
```

#### Monitor Layout Changes
If you've rearranged your physical monitors or changed display settings:

**üöÄ Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)**
```bash
# Re-run the setup script to auto-detect and update configuration
./setup-monitor-fix.sh
```

**üîß Option 2: Manual Update**
```bash
# Check current monitor configuration
xrandr --query | grep connected

# Manually edit the fix script
nano ~/.local/bin/fix-monitors.sh

# Update the xrandr command, then restart service
systemctl --user restart monitor-fix.service
```

**üß™ Option 3: Test First**
```bash
# Test current xrandr command to see if it still works
~/.local/bin/test-monitor-fix.sh
```

**‚ö° Option 4: Quick Update (Experimental)**
```bash
# Use the experimental quick update script
./quick-update-monitors.sh
```
This attempts to auto-detect and apply layout changes quickly. Use with caution for complex layouts.

#### Overlapping Monitor Coordinates
If monitors have conflicting positions (common after layout changes):
```bash
# Check for overlapping coordinates
xrandr --query | grep -E "connected.*[0-9]+x[0-9]+\+[0-9]+\+[0-9]+"

# Fix by re-running setup or manually editing the script
vim ~/.local/bin/fix-monitors.sh
systemctl --user restart monitor-fix.service
```

### üîÑ Service Management

```bash
# Start service
systemctl --user start monitor-fix.service

# Stop service
systemctl --user stop monitor-fix.service

# Restart service
systemctl --user restart monitor-fix.service

# Enable service (auto-start)
systemctl --user enable monitor-fix.service

# Disable service
systemctl --user disable monitor-fix.service

# View logs
journalctl --user -u monitor-fix.service -f
```

### üìä Monitoring and Logs

The system creates several log files for monitoring:

- **Setup Log**: `~/monitor-fix-setup.log` - Installation and configuration details
- **Runtime Log**: `~/.local/share/monitor-fix.log` - Monitor fix events and errors
- **Service Log**: Via `journalctl --user -u monitor-fix.service` - Systemd service logs

### üîç Advanced Configuration

#### Diagnosing Monitor Configuration Issues
```bash
# Check current monitor layout for conflicts
xrandr --query | grep -E "(Screen 0|connected)"

# Verify monitor fix script configuration
cat ~/.local/bin/fix-monitors.sh | grep -A5 -B5 xrandr

# Compare with actual current layout
echo "=== Current Layout ===" && xrandr --query | grep connected
echo "=== Script Configuration ===" && grep -A3 "Execute the xrandr command" ~/.local/bin/fix-monitors.sh
```

#### Custom Monitor Layout
If you need to modify the monitor layout after installation:

1. Edit the script: `vim ~/.local/bin/fix-monitors.sh`
2. Update the xrandr command in the script
3. Restart the service: `systemctl --user restart monitor-fix.service`

#### Different Display Arrangement
To change your display arrangement:

1. Configure displays in Settings ‚Üí Displays
2. Re-run the setup script: `./setup-monitor-fix.sh`
3. Choose to update the existing configuration

### üÜò Common Issues

**Issue**: Script doesn't detect monitors correctly
**Solution**: Ensure you're in an X11 session and monitors are properly connected

**Issue**: Service fails to start
**Solution**: Check that dbus-monitor is available and X11 session is active

**Issue**: Monitors restore but in wrong positions
**Solution**: Re-run setup script after configuring displays in System Settings

**Issue**: Script works manually but not automatically
**Solution**: Check service logs for D-Bus permission issues

**Issue**: Monitor fix service running but monitors still not restoring correctly
**Solution**: Check if monitor layout has changed since initial setup. Monitor positions may have shifted causing overlapping coordinates. Use `xrandr --query | grep connected` to verify current layout matches the script configuration.

**Issue**: Service running but no log entries or activity detected
**Solution**: The monitor fix script may have syntax errors. Common issues:
- Missing `done` statement in while loop
- Incorrect D-Bus parsing (looking for multi-line output on single line)
Check script syntax: `bash -n ~/.local/bin/fix-monitors.sh`

**Issue**: D-Bus events not being detected by the service
**Solution**: The script may be using incorrect pattern matching for D-Bus output. D-Bus signals put `member=ActiveChanged` and `boolean false` on separate lines. The script needs to use state-based parsing, not single-line pattern matching.

**Issue**: Overlapping monitor coordinates (e.g., multiple monitors at position 0,0)
**Solution**: This is a common cause of display conflicts. Re-run the setup script or manually edit `~/.local/bin/fix-monitors.sh` to fix monitor positioning. Ensure each monitor has unique, non-overlapping coordinates.

### üìö Understanding the Solution

This fix addresses a common issue where NVIDIA drivers fail to properly restore multi-monitor configurations after screen lock/unlock cycles. The solution:

1. **Monitors D-Bus Events**: Listens for screen unlock signals
2. **Restores Configuration**: Applies the correct xrandr command after unlock
3. **Handles Timing**: Waits for desktop stabilization before applying changes
4. **Provides Logging**: Tracks all events for troubleshooting

## Real-World Issue Resolution

### Case Study: Service Running But Not Working
**Detected Issue**: Monitor fix service was running but monitors weren't restoring correctly after unlock, with overlapping coordinates persisting.

**Root Cause**: Two critical script errors were preventing automatic functionality:
1. **Missing `done` statement**: The monitor fix script was missing the closing `done` for the while loop, causing script malfunction
2. **Incorrect D-Bus parsing**: Script was looking for both `member=ActiveChanged` and `boolean false` on the same line, but D-Bus output puts them on separate lines

**Resolution Steps**:
1. Identified overlapping monitors using `xrandr --query | grep connected`
2. Discovered script syntax error - missing `done` statement in while loop
3. Found D-Bus parsing issue - single-line pattern matching failed for multi-line D-Bus output
4. Fixed script with proper while loop closure and state machine for D-Bus parsing
5. Updated monitor fix script with correct xrandr command
6. Restarted service to apply changes

**Technical Details**:
- **Before**: `dbus-monitor | while read line; do ... fi` (missing `done`)
- **After**: Added proper `done` statement and improved D-Bus parsing with state tracking
- **D-Bus Fix**: Used flag-based approach to handle `ActiveChanged` and `boolean false` on separate lines

**Key Lesson**: The service may appear to be running correctly but fail silently due to script syntax errors or incorrect D-Bus event parsing. Always verify the actual script logic, not just service status.

### Case Study: User Rearranged Physical Monitors
**Situation**: User physically rearranged monitors and asked what to do next.

**Current Layout After Rearrangement**:
- DP-1: 1920√ó1080 at (0,0) - Left monitor
- HDMI-0: 1920√ó1080 at (1920,0) - Right monitor  
- DP-4: 2560√ó1600 at (605,1080) - Primary (bottom center)

**Resolution**: Updated the fix script configuration to match new layout and restarted service.

**Recommendation**: When rearranging monitors, always run `./setup-monitor-fix.sh` to automatically detect and update the configuration.
